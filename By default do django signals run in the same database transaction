#Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. Django signals like post_save and pre_save are connected to database operations, 
#and if the signal is triggered during a transaction, 
#it will run within that same transaction. 
# If the transaction is rolled back, the signal's changes will also be rolled back.
