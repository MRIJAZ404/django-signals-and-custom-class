#Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. 
#The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.


# signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import threading

@receiver(post_save)
def print_thread_name(sender, instance, **kwargs): #The print_thread_name function is connected to the post_save signal, which gets triggered when a new MyModel instance is saved.
    print(f"Signal received in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}") #In the signal handler, we print the thread's name using threading.current_thread().name

# models.py
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):#When the create_model_instance view is accessed, it creates a MyModel instance, which triggers the post_save signal.
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MyModel

def create_model_instance(request):
    instance = MyModel.objects.create(name="Test Instance")
    return render(request, 'index.html') #the Html code will be rendered
