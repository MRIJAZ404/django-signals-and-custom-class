#Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. By default, Django signals are synchronous,
#meaning they execute in the same thread that triggered the signal. 
#This means that any processing done in the signal handler will block the execution of the code that triggered the signal until the handler is complete.

    print(f"Signal received in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}") #In the signal handler, we print the thread's name using threading.current_thread().name

# models.py
from django.db import models
